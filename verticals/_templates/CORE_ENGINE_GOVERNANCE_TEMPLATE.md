# 🧬 CORE — {ENGINE_CODE} ENGINE GOVERNANCE (CANONICAL)

Engine: {ENGINE_CODE} ({ENGINE_NAME})  
Authority Level: Engine-Level Governance Law  
Parent Platform: CORE  
Effective Date: Upon Engine Activation  

---

## 🧠 ENGINE IDENTITY

{ENGINE_CODE} is a single-domain physics engine.

It exists to:
- Generate domain-specific physical truth
- Produce deterministic, reproducible outputs
- Emit validated artifacts for interpretation

{ENGINE_CODE} does NOT:
- Manage identity
- Manage permissions
- Manage pricing
- Publish results independently
- Correlate cross-engine data

---

## ⚖️ GOVERNANCE INHERITANCE (BINDING)

{ENGINE_CODE} is permanently subordinate to:

1. CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
2. CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
3. CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md  
4. CORE_TENANT_BOUNDARY_AND_DATA_SEPARATION_LAW.md  
5. CORE_EXPERIMENT_INTEGRITY_AND_REPRODUCIBILITY_LAW.md  
6. CORE_TELEMETRY_OBSERVABILITY_CONSENT_LAW.md  
7. CORE_SENSOR_IO_SAFETY_AND_MISUSE_PREVENTION_LAW.md  

If any conflict exists → CORE law wins immediately.

## 🔬 DOMAIN SCOPE

Primary domain:
- {PRIMARY_DOMAIN}

Inputs:
- {INPUTS}

Outputs:
- {OUTPUTS}

{ENGINE_CODE} may only operate within this declared scope.

---

## 🔒 DATA & EXECUTION RULES

- Deterministic execution required
- No network access in physics core
- No authentication in physics core
- Artifacts sealed per CORE law
- No post-seal modification

---

## 🔁 CROSS-ENGINE DATA FLOW

{ENGINE_CODE} may receive data from other engines ONLY when:

- Exported explicitly by a user
- Approved by CORE permissions
- Logged and auditable

Implicit coupling is forbidden.

---

## 🛑 PROHIBITED USE

{ENGINE_CODE} may not be used for:
- Covert surveillance
- Unsafe configurations
- Weaponization
- Identity inference
- Data falsification

Violations are enforced under:
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md

---

## 🧾 GIT-LOCKED AUTHORITY

If it is not written in CORE governance files →  
it has no authority over {ENGINE_CODE}.

---

## ✅ RATIFICATION

Ratified by:
- CORE_VERTICAL_REGISTRY.md  
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md
