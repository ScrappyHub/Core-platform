# CORE ENGINE — {ENGINE_CODE} GOVERNANCE (CANONICAL)

Engine Key: {ENGINE_CODE}  
Engine Role: TRUTH_ENGINE | TRUTH_ADJACENT_COMPUTE | FUSION_ENGINE  
Authority Level: Engine Governance (Binding)  
Status: ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL  

## 1. Governance Inheritance

This engine is permanently subordinate to CORE platform law.

Inherited base governance:
- {BASE_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE}.md
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md
- CORE_EXPERIMENT_INTEGRITY_AND_REPRODUCIBILITY_LAW.md
- CORE_TENANT_BOUNDARY_AND_DATA_SEPARATION_LAW.md

If any conflict exists → CORE law prevails immediately.

## 2. Engine Scope

(Engine-specific physics scope only.)

## 3. Explicit Non-Scope

(Explicit prohibitions.)

## 4. Execution & Determinism

- Deterministic execution required
- No network access
- Inputs delivered by CORE runtime only
- Outputs returned to CORE only
- No post-seal mutation

## 5. Artifacts & Sealing Expectations

- RUN_BUNDLE_SPEC.md
- SEALING_SPEC.md

Engine emits schema-valid outputs only.

## 6. Coupling Semantics

- No peer delivery
- No implicit coupling
- CORE mediates all data flow
- Coupling rules are declarative, not executable

## 7. Prohibited Use

(Explicit list.)

## 8. Change Control

Manifest + registry update required.

## 9. Declaration

This engine emits physics truth only.  
Meaning and action are applied by CORE lenses.
