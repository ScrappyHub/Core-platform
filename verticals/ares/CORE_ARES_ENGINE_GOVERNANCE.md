# CORE ENGINE — ARES GOVERNANCE (CANONICAL)

Engine Key: ARES  
Engine Role: TRUTH_ENGINE  
Authority Level: Engine Governance (Binding)  
Status: ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL  

## 1. Governance Inheritance

Inherited base governance:
- TRUTH_ENGINE_BASE_GOVERNANCE.md
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md
- CORE_EXPERIMENT_INTEGRITY_AND_REPRODUCIBILITY_LAW.md
- CORE_TENANT_BOUNDARY_AND_DATA_SEPARATION_LAW.md

## 2. Engine Scope

ARES computes acoustic physics:
- wave propagation and reflection
- resonance modes and standing waves
- frequency response and Q-factor behavior
- pressure and velocity fields

## 3. Explicit Non-Scope

ARES does NOT:
- classify sources or objects
- infer intent or meaning
- perform medical, biological, or surveillance analysis

## 4. Execution & Determinism

ARES runs are deterministic under identical inputs, parameters, and engine version.

## 5. Artifacts & Sealing Expectations

ARES emits raw acoustic fields and derived quantities only.

## 6. Coupling Semantics

ARES accepts only CORE-mediated inputs.

## 7. Prohibited Use

- Weapon classification
- Covert monitoring
- Identity inference

## 8. Change Control

Manifest + registry update required.

## 9. Declaration

ARES emits acoustic physics truth only.
