# 🧬 CORE — RGSR ENGINE GOVERNANCE (CANONICAL)

Engine: RGSR (Resonant Geophysical Systems Research)  
Authority Level: Engine Law  
Parent Platform: CORE  
Effective Date: First RGSR Public Deployment  

---

## 🧠 ENGINE IDENTITY

RGSR is a **multi-domain physics fusion engine**.

It is NOT:
- A simulator
- A SaaS dashboard
- A toy experiment
- A single-domain solver

RGSR is a **distributed scientific instrument platform**.

---

## ⚖️ GOVERNANCE INHERITANCE (BINDING)

RGSR is permanently bound by:

- CORE Platform Constitution
- CORE Constitutional Stop Layer
- CORE Engine Registry & Inheritance Law
- CORE Experiment Integrity & Reproducibility Law
- CORE Telemetry & Consent Law
- CORE Data Boundary & Separation Law

RGSR may not override any CORE law.

---

## 🧱 RGSR FOUR-LAYER ARCHITECTURE (LOCKED)

### Layer 1 — Physics Core
- Deterministic
- Headless
- Scriptable
- No auth
- No network
- Cryptographically verifiable

Produces:
- RUN_CONDITIONS.json
- SHA256SUMS.txt
- FFTs
- Peak sets
- Perturbation deltas

This layer is immutable truth.

---

### Layer 2 — RGSR Workbench (Local Instrument)
- Project control
- Visualization
- Role enforcement
- Artifact signing
- Feature flags

No global identity control.

---

### Layer 3 — Cloud Coordination (Ledger)
- Artifact storage
- Hash verification
- Immutable run locking
- Peer review & replication
- Audit trails

This layer is the scientific ledger.

---

### Layer 4 — Governance & Distribution
- Identity integration
- Roles & permissions
- Publication approval
- Moderation
- Admin tooling
- Safety gates

This layer prevents misuse, fraud, and manipulation.

## 🧭 CANONICAL ROLE MODEL (CORE-COMPATIBLE)

| Role | Run | Publish | View Others | Modify Profiles |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Observer | ❌ | ❌ | Public | ❌ |
| Researcher | ✅ | ❌ | Limited | ❌ |
| Scientist | ✅ | ✅ | Peer | ❌ |
| Lab Admin | ✅ | ✅ | Lab | ✅ |
| Platform Admin | ✅ | ✅ | All | ✅ |

All role actions are:
- Logged
- Audited
- Revocable

---

## 🔒 DATA & ARTIFACT RULES

- Runs are immutable once sealed
- Artifacts are hash-verified
- Reproducibility is mandatory
- No silent modification permitted
- All exports are permission-gated

---

## 🛑 PROHIBITED USE

RGSR may NOT be used for:
- Data falsification
- Covert surveillance
- Weaponization
- Manipulative experiments
- Unreviewed public claims

Violations trigger:
- Immediate access revocation
- Audit investigation
- Permanent record

---

## 🧾 GIT IS LAW

If it is not written in GitHub governance files → it has no authority over RGSR.

---

## ✅ RATIFICATION

Ratified by:
- CORE Engine Registry
- CORE Platform Constitution
- CORE Constitutional Stop Layer
