# 🧬 CORE — RGSR ENGINE GOVERNANCE (CANONICAL)

Engine: RGSR (Resonant Geophysical Systems Research)  
Authority Level: Engine-Level Governance Law  
Parent Platform: CORE  
Effective Date: First RGSR Public Deployment  

---

## 🧠 ENGINE IDENTITY

RGSR is a multi-domain physics fusion engine.

RGSR is NOT:
- A simulator
- A SaaS dashboard
- A consumer application
- A single-domain solver

RGSR is a **distributed scientific instrument platform**.

---

## ⚖️ GOVERNANCE INHERITANCE (BINDING)

RGSR is permanently governed by, and subordinate to:

1. CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
2. CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
3. CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md  
4. CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md  

No RGSR subsystem may override these authorities.

## 🧱 RGSR FOUR-LAYER ARCHITECTURE (LOCKED)

### Layer 1 — Physics Core

Governed by:
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md

Properties:
- Deterministic
- Headless
- Scriptable
- No authentication
- No network access
- Cryptographically verifiable

Produces immutable artifacts:
- RUN_CONDITIONS.json
- SHA256SUMS.txt
- FFT outputs
- Peak sets
- Perturbation deltas

---

### Layer 2 — RGSR Workbench (Local Instrument)

Governed by:
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md

Responsibilities:
- Project control
- Visualization
- Local role enforcement
- Artifact signing
- Feature flag compliance

No global identity authority exists here.

---

### Layer 3 — Cloud Coordination Ledger

Governed by:
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md

Responsibilities:
- Artifact storage
- Hash verification
- Immutable run locking
- Replication & peer review
- Audit logging

---

### Layer 4 — Governance & Distribution

Governed by:
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md

Responsibilities:
- Identity integration
- Role enforcement
- Publication approval
- Moderation
- Safety & misuse prevention

## 🧭 CANONICAL ROLE MODEL (CORE-COMPATIBLE)

| Role | Run | Publish | View Others | Modify Profiles |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Observer | ❌ | ❌ | Public | ❌ |
| Researcher | ✅ | ❌ | Limited | ❌ |
| Scientist | ✅ | ✅ | Peer | ❌ |
| Lab Admin | ✅ | ✅ | Lab | ✅ |
| Platform Admin | ✅ | ✅ | All | ✅ |

All role actions are:
- Logged
- Audited
- Revocable

---

## 🔒 DATA & ARTIFACT RULES

- Runs are immutable once sealed
- Artifacts are cryptographically verified
- Reproducibility is mandatory
- Silent modification is forbidden
- Export requires permission

---

## 🛑 PROHIBITED USE

RGSR may not be used for:
- Data falsification
- Covert surveillance
- Weaponization
- Unreviewed public claims
- Manipulation of results

Violations trigger enforcement under:
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md

---

## 🧾 GIT-LOCKED AUTHORITY

If a rule is not written in CORE governance files →  
it has no authority over RGSR.

---

## ✅ RATIFICATION

Ratified by:
- CORE_VERTICAL_REGISTRY.md  
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md
