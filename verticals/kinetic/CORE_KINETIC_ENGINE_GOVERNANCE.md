# 🧱 CORE ENGINE — KINETIC GOVERNANCE (CANONICAL)

File: `verticals/kinetic/CORE_KINETIC_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md`  
Engine Key: **KINETIC**  
Authority Level: Engine Governance (Binding)  
Status: ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL  

## 1. Authority & Inheritance

KINETIC inherits CORE law and registry contract.

## 2. Scope

KINETIC models structural mechanics:
- stress/strain fields
- deformation and displacement
- modal vibration and damping
- resonance energy transfer
- failure risk indicators (derived only)

## 3. Non-Scope

KINETIC may NOT:
- act as an engineering sign-off authority
- make safety guarantees
- bypass CORE publishing permissions

## 4. Determinism

Must log geometry, materials, force/excitation sets, and solver configs.

## 5. Required Artifacts

- `ENGINE_MANIFEST.json`
- `RUN_CONDITIONS.json`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- `DEFORMATION_FIELD.json`
- `MODE_SHAPES.json`
- `STRESS_STRAIN.json`
- `DAMPING_REPORT.json`
- `ARTIFACT_INDEX.json`

## 6. Safety & Misuse Controls

Outputs must clearly label:
- modeled vs measured data
- limits and assumptions
- lack of regulatory certification

## 7. Publishing Rules

Sealed run required.

## 8. Amendments

Governance review required.
