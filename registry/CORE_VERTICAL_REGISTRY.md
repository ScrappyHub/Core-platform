# 🧾 CORE — VERTICAL REGISTRY (CANONICAL)

File: `registry/CORE_VERTICAL_REGISTRY.md`  
Authority Level: Binding Registry Index  
Status: ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL  
Effective Date: First Public CORE Deployment  

## 1. Purpose

This file is the authoritative registry of engines (vertical work engines) recognized by CORE.
Anything not listed here is not a valid CORE engine.

## 2. Authority & Inheritance

All engines listed here inherit:
- `CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md`
- `CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`
- `CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md`
- `CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md`
- `CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_CONTRACT.md`

## 3. Canonical Engine Family (Truth Layer)

## 4. Registry Change Rules

Adding/removing/modifying an engine requires:
- governance review
- engine governance file present
- registry update committed with audit trace

If an engine is not in this registry, CORE must refuse to run it.
