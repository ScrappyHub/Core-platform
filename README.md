# CORE PLATFORM — MASTER CONTROL REPOSITORY (CANONICAL)

CORE is a governed meta-infrastructure platform.

This repository is the **single source of truth** for:

- CORE identity & boundaries
- CORE governance law (Git-locked)
- Enforcement hierarchy (Git → Systems → Admin RPCs → UI)
- Curation doctrine (what CORE will and will not host/enable)
- Contributor & AI governance contract
- Founder protection & succession constraints

❌ No production application code lives here  
✅ This repository is the **governance brain** of CORE

---

## 🔒 SUPREME AUTHORITY

- `governance/CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`  
  → Highest authority inside CORE  
- `governance/CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md`  
  → Absolute non-overrideable lock layer

If anything in any CORE repository conflicts with the Constitution →  
**the Constitution wins instantly**, unless the Stop Layer overrides it.

Cross-Reference:
- `governance/CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md`

## 🛡️ GOVERNANCE FIRST (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

CORE is permanently built on:

- Safety-first design
- Consent-first data rules
- Non-extractive infrastructure doctrine
- Anti-profiling / non-identity sorting
- No silent power / no shadow privileges
- Git-locked authority
- Audit-first enforcement

These rules apply to:

✅ CORE services  
✅ CORE tooling & admin systems  
✅ All curated platforms/products that run on CORE (as applicable)  
✅ All UI surfaces  
✅ All AI contributors  

There are **no exemptions**.

## 🧱 WHAT CORE IS (AND IS NOT)

CORE is:

- Meta infrastructure
- Governance enforcement layer
- Trust-first platform tooling
- Curation & compliance framework

CORE is NOT:

- An ad-tech company
- A surveillance layer
- A demographic targeting engine
- A profiling-based discovery engine
- A platform that sells identity access

## ⚠️ RULES FOR CONTRIBUTORS / AI (BINDING)

❌ No governance modification outside this repo  
❌ No RLS / policy disabling in governed systems  
❌ No silent schema changes  
❌ No backdoor admin power  
❌ No profiling fields or identity targeting  
❌ No tracking SDKs without explicit consent law

✅ Allowed without Stop Layer review:

- Auditing
- Hardening

- Accessibility & performance
- Security validation
- Implementation that strictly follows law

Any violation = **Governance-Breaking Event**

## ✅ FINAL STATEMENT

CORE exists to protect:

- Humans before markets  
- Safety before growth  
- Consent before data  
- Governance before convenience  

If CORE violates its own law →  
it is no longer CORE.
