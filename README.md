# 🧠 CORE PLATFORM — GOVERNED SCIENTIFIC OPERATING SYSTEM

CORE is a **meta-infrastructure platform** for running, governing, and coordinating
physics-grade work engines and scientific systems.

CORE is not a simulator.  
CORE is not a solver.  
CORE has **no physics of its own**.

CORE is the **operating system**.

---

## 🧩 WHAT CORE IS

CORE provides:

- Identity & account system
- Project & lab isolation
- Data & artifact storage
- Cryptographic experiment sealing
- Engine registry & lifecycle
- Permissions & roles
- Feature flags & entitlements
- Audit logging
- Visualization shell
- Governance enforcement

CORE exists so that **scientific truth can be produced, shared, and trusted** without
silent mutation, inference leakage, or power concentration.

---

## 🧪 WHAT CORE IS NOT

CORE does NOT:

- Implement physics solvers
- Perform simulations itself
- Interpret scientific meaning
- Control experimental conclusions
- Replace domain expertise

All **truth generation** happens inside engines.

## 🧠 CORE VS WORK ENGINES (CANONICAL)

### CORE (Operating System)

- Users
- Projects
- Labs
- Data
- Permissions
- Governance
- Auditability

### WORK ENGINES (Physics Truth Layer)

Each engine is its own repo and domain, with its own:

- Solvers
- State models
- Inputs & outputs
- Validation logic
- Deterministic execution

Engines share:
- UI shell
- Storage
- Visualization
- Governance enforcement

They **do not** share physics.

---

## 🔒 GOVERNANCE IS NON-OPTIONAL

CORE is a **law-bound platform**.

All authority flows through:

📄 `/governance/CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_AND_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md`

If a rule is not written in GitHub governance files →  
**it has no authority inside CORE**.

---

## 🧭 CANONICAL ENGINE FAMILY

CORE currently governs the following engines:

1. RGSR — Unified multi-domain fusion  
2. ARES — Acoustic resonance  
3. HYDRA — Water & fluid resonance  
4. THERMOS — Thermal dynamics  
5. MAGNETAR — Electromagnetic fields  
6. LITHOS — Geology & materials  
7. ATMOS — Atmospheric physics  
8. KINETIC — Structural mechanics  
9. CRYSTAL — Lattice & molecular  
10. SIGNAL — Sensor fusion & inference  

Registry:  
`registry/CORE_VERTICAL_REGISTRY.md`

## 🛡 TRUST & INTEGRITY GUARANTEES

CORE guarantees:

- Experiments are immutable once sealed
- Artifacts are cryptographically verifiable
- Projects are isolated by default
- Engines cannot read each other’s private data
- Admins cannot silently override law
- Telemetry is minimal and consent-bound

Public summary:

## 📁 REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
/governance → Binding platform law
/registry → Canonical engine registry
/verticals → Engine governance (no physics code)
/architecture → System design references
/docs → Non-law documentation

---

## 🧾 FINAL STATEMENT

CORE exists to make **real science harder to fake**.

If CORE ever violates its own governance →  
it is no longer CORE.
