# FUSION ENGINE BASE GOVERNANCE (Canonical V1)

Applies to: RGSR (fusion engine)  
Authority: Binding

## Scope
Fusion engines compute cross-engine relationship structures only:
- correlation
- coherence
- coupling strength estimates
- confidence/uncertainty surfaces

## Hard Prohibitions
Fusion engines MUST NOT:
- generate new physics
- make causal claims
- provide attribution language (missile/rocket/submarine intent)
- accept peer delivery
- access network resources
- emit identity/governance/billing fields

## Delivery Model
Inputs are delivered by CORE only.  
Engines never accept peer delivery.

## Required Outputs
- inputs_hash
- outputs_hash
- semantics = CORRELATION_ONLY
- input_artifact_index (hash list of all upstream artifacts)
