# 🗺 CORE — GOVERNANCE MAP (CANONICAL)

Authority Level: Index / Reference (Non-Authoritative)  
Purpose: Provide a complete, auditable map of CORE governance documents, their scope, and their authority relationships.

This file introduces **no new rules**.  
It accurately reflects binding law defined elsewhere.

---

## 🔒 SUPREME AUTHORITY (TOP OF STACK)

1. **CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md**  
   - Absolute authority
   - No overrides
   - No exceptions
   - Enforced across all CORE systems, engines, and actors

2. **CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md**  
   - Defines CORE identity, scope, and non-negotiable principles
   - Subordinate only to the Stop Layer

---

## ⚖️ PLATFORM-WIDE GOVERNANCE LAWS

These laws apply to **all CORE systems and engines**:

- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md  
- CORE_EXPERIMENT_INTEGRITY_AND_REPRODUCIBILITY_LAW.md  
- CORE_TELEMETRY_OBSERVABILITY_CONSENT_LAW.md  
- CORE_SENSOR_IO_SAFETY_AND_MISUSE_PREVENTION_LAW.md  
- CORE_TENANT_BOUNDARY_AND_DATA_SEPARATION_LAW.md  
- CORE_PRICING_TIERS_AND_ENGINE_ENTITLEMENTS_LAW.md  
- CORE_PLATFORM_OPERATIONS_AND_ADMIN_AUTHORIZATION_LAW.md  

Violations of any of the above are enforced under:
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md

## 🧠 REGISTRY & STRUCTURE

- **registry/CORE_VERTICAL_REGISTRY.md**  
  - Canonical list of engines permitted inside CORE
  - Engines not listed here do not legally exist

- **verticals/**  
  - Engine-specific governance files
  - Each engine is bound to CORE law via explicit inheritance

---

## 🧬 ENGINE GOVERNANCE (CURRENT)

Active / Defined Engines:

- verticals/rgsr/CORE_RGSR_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md  
- verticals/ares/CORE_ARES_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md  
- verticals/hydra/CORE_HYDRA_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md  
- verticals/thermos/CORE_THERMOS_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md  
- verticals/magnetar/CORE_MAGNETAR_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md  
- verticals/lithos/CORE_LITHOS_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md  
- verticals/atmos/CORE_ATMOS_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md  
- verticals/kinetic/CORE_KINETIC_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md  
- verticals/crystal/CORE_CRYSTAL_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md  
- verticals/signal/CORE_SIGNAL_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md  

Each engine file:
- Defines domain scope
- Prohibits cross-engine overreach
- Inherits all CORE platform law

## 🧾 PUBLIC & TRUST-FACING DOCUMENTS

These summarize binding law without replacing it:

- CORE_PUBLIC_TRUST_AND_SCIENTIFIC_INTEGRITY_STATEMENT.md  

---

## 🧭 CONTRIBUTOR & AI BINDING

These documents bind all contributors and automated agents:

- CORE_CONTRIBUTOR_AI_GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT.md  
- CORE_CONTRIBUTOR_GOVERNANCE_NOTICE.md  

---

## 🧱 OPERATIONAL ENFORCEMENT

Governance is enforced via:

- GitHub governance repositories
- Branch protection & CODEOWNERS
- Audit-logged admin operations
- Feature flags & entitlements
- Storage isolation & permissions
- Engine-level execution constraints

---

## 🧾 FINAL NOTE

This map is informational.

If any discrepancy exists between this map and binding law:  
**binding law wins immediately**.
