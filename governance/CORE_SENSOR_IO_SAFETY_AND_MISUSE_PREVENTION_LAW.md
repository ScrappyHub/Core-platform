## 🧠 PURPOSE

CORE supports sensor I/O and physics engines.

This law exists to ensure CORE is never used for:

- Covert surveillance
- Harmful experimentation
- Unsafe data collection
- Weaponized configurations

This is a safety and integrity law, not a political one.

---

## ✅ ALLOWED SENSOR I/O

CORE permits sensor I/O that is:

- User-owned
- User-controlled
- Experiment-bound
- Transparent
- Logged
- Auditable

---

## ❌ PROHIBITED SENSOR USE

It is forbidden to:

- Operate sensors without operator knowledge
- Collect data from non-consenting subjects
- Obscure sensor purpose
- Guide users toward destructive configurations
- Enable covert monitoring workflows

---

## 🔒 ENGINE RESPONSIBILITY

Each engine must:

- Declare its sensor interfaces
- Validate inputs
- Reject unsafe configurations
- Enforce CORE safety flags

Engines that fail to comply are invalidated.

---

## 🛑 ENFORCEMENT

Violations result in:

- Immediate suspension
- Audit review
- Registry removal if necessary

Enforced under:
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md

---

## 🧾 GIT-LOCKED AUTHORITY

Sensor safety rules exist only as written in GitHub.

---

## ✅ RATIFICATION

Ratified by:
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md
