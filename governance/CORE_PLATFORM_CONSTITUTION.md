# 📜 CORE PLATFORM CONSTITUTION (CANONICAL)

Authority Level: SUPREME PLATFORM LAW  
Enforcement Chain: GitHub → Systems (DB/RLS/Policies + Services) → Admin RPCs → UI  
Protected By: CORE Constitutional Stop Layer  

This Constitution defines:

- CORE identity and scope
- CORE ethical boundaries
- CORE power limits
- CORE curation & hosting doctrine
- CORE anti-profiling and non-extractive infrastructure rules
- CORE contributor enforcement expectations

If anything conflicts with this Constitution → this Constitution wins,  
unless the Stop Layer overrides it.

- `CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md`

## 🧭 CORE IDENTITY

CORE is a governed meta-infrastructure business that provides:

- Platform tooling
- Compliance & governance frameworks
- Trust-first operational primitives
- Curated enablement (what CORE will support/host/ship)

CORE does not sell identity access, does not run surveillance capitalism,
and does not permit hidden policy changes.

## 🧾 GIT-LOCKED SOVEREIGNTY

If a rule is not in GitHub governance files → it has **no legal standing** inside CORE.

All enforceable authority must live in:

- GitHub governance files
- Governed policy definitions (RLS/policies where applicable)
- Canonical service enforcement rules
- Audit-logged admin RPCs

---

## ⚙️ NO UNLIMITED POWER

No admin, founder, developer, contractor, service account, or system may bypass governance.

Power must always be:

✅ Logged  
✅ Audited  
✅ Role-scoped  
✅ Time-bounded where possible  
✅ Reversible where possible

- `CORE_FOUNDER_PROTECTION_AND_SUCCESSION.md`

## 🚫 ANTI-PROFILING & NON-IDENTITY SORTING LAW

CORE prohibits profiling, ranking, targeting, or discovery sorting by:

- Race
- Ethnicity / national origin
- Skin color
- Religion
- Political belief
- Gender identity
- Sexual orientation
- Immigration status
- Family structure
- Disability

✅ Never required  
✅ Never inferred  
✅ Never ranked  
✅ Never targeted  

CORE may provide tools for **safety**, **compliance**, and **consent** —  
not identity exploitation.

---

## 🧠 CONSENT-FIRST DATA DOCTRINE

CORE must not introduce:

- Invisible tracking
- Fingerprinting
- Shadow analytics
- Third-party data resale paths

Any analytics or telemetry must be:

✅ Explicitly disclosed  
✅ Consent-gated (where applicable)  
✅ Minimal and purpose-bound  
✅ Auditable and removable  

---

## 🧱 CURATION & ENABLEMENT DOCTRINE

CORE may refuse to host, enable, or support systems that require:

- Surveillance capitalism
- Demographic targeting
- Ad-tech extraction
- Dark patterns
- Monetization that relies on harm, coercion, or unsafe users

CORE is permitted to curate and enforce its standards as a condition of participation.

(Platform-specific curation rules can be added as canonical appendices.)

## 🛑 GOVERNANCE-BREAKING EVENT

Any attempt to:

- Disable governance enforcement
- Introduce shadow power
- Add profiling fields
- Add silent tracking
- Rewrite law without Git record

…is a Governance-Breaking Event and triggers:

- Immediate rollback where possible
- Privilege revocation
- Forensic audit
- Permanent record in governance logs

---

## ✅ RATIFICATION

Ratified by:

- CORE Founder
- CORE Governance Framework
- First Public Deployment
