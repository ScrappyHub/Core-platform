# 📜 CORE PLATFORM CONSTITUTION (CANONICAL)

Authority Level: SUPREME PLATFORM LAW  
Protected By: CORE Constitutional Stop Layer  
Enforcement: Git Governance → System Enforcement (DB/RLS/Policies/Services) → Audit-Logged Admin RPCs → UI  

If any behavior or document conflicts with this Constitution, this Constitution wins—unless the Stop Layer overrides it.

## 1) CORE IDENTITY

CORE is governed meta-infrastructure that provides:

- Project/workspace isolation (tenant boundaries)
- Engine registration and lifecycle control
- Deterministic execution orchestration
- Artifact storage, sealing, replay, and verification
- Access control, entitlements, and quotas
- Audit logging and compliance enforcement
- Curated enablement: what CORE will host/support/ship

CORE is not a surveillance platform, not an ad-tech platform, and not an identity monetization business.

---

## 2) GIT-LOCKED SOVEREIGNTY

A rule has authority inside CORE only if it is written in Git-governed law files (or enforced system policies derived from them).

No silent policy changes exist.  
No UI behavior overrides law.  
No undocumented “operational exceptions” exist.

---

## 3) NO UNLIMITED POWER

No founder, admin, developer, contractor, service account, or system actor may bypass governance.

All privileged power must be:
- Logged (append-only)
- Attributed to an identity
- Role-scoped
- Reviewable
- Revocable where possible

---

## 4) ANTI-PROFILING & NON-EXTRACTIVE DOCTRINE

CORE prohibits profiling, ranking, targeting, or discovery sorting by protected attributes, including but not limited to:
- Race, ethnicity, national origin, skin color
- Religion
- Political belief
- Gender identity, sexual orientation
- Immigration status, disability, family structure

CORE may support safety and compliance tools, but never identity exploitation.

---

## 5) CONSENT-FIRST DATA DOCTRINE

CORE must not introduce:
- Invisible tracking
- Fingerprinting
- Shadow analytics
- Third-party resale paths

Telemetry/analytics, if any, must be:
- Explicitly disclosed
- Purpose-bound and minimal
- Consent-gated where applicable
- Auditable and removable

---

## 6) CURATION & ENABLEMENT DOCTRINE

CORE may refuse to host/enable/support systems that require:
- Surveillance capitalism
- Demographic targeting
- Dark patterns
- Monetization dependent on harm, coercion, or unsafe use

Participation is conditional on compliance with CORE law.

---

## 7) GOVERNANCE-BREAKING EVENT

Any attempt to:
- Disable governance enforcement
- Add shadow power or hidden privileges
- Add profiling fields/pipelines
- Add hidden tracking
- Modify law without Git history

…is a Governance-Breaking Event and triggers:
- Immediate rollback where possible
- Privilege revocation
- Forensic audit
- Permanent audit record

---
