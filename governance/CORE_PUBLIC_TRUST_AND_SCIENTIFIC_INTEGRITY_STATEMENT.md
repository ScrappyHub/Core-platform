# 🧭 CORE — PUBLIC TRUST & SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT (CANONICAL)

Authority Level: Binding Public Governance Statement  
Derived From (Authoritative Sources):

- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md  
- CORE_EXPERIMENT_INTEGRITY_AND_REPRODUCIBILITY_LAW.md  
- CORE_TENANT_BOUNDARY_AND_DATA_SEPARATION_LAW.md  
- CORE_PLATFORM_OPERATIONS_AND_ADMIN_AUTHORIZATION_LAW.md  

This statement is a **public-facing declaration** of how CORE operates, what it guarantees, and what it will never do.

It does not replace governance law.  
It summarizes it accurately.

---

## 🧠 WHAT CORE IS

CORE is a governed scientific operating system.

It exists to:

- Run physics-grade work engines
- Preserve experimental truth
- Enable reproducible science
- Coordinate multi-domain research safely
- Prevent misuse, manipulation, and extraction

CORE is not a simulator.  
CORE is not a data marketplace.  
CORE is not an analytics surveillance platform.

CORE is infrastructure for reality-coherent science.

---

## 🧪 SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY GUARANTEES

CORE guarantees that:

- Experiments are reproducible
- Results are cryptographically verifiable
- Artifacts cannot be silently altered
- Failed runs are not erased
- Provenance is preserved end-to-end

These guarantees are enforced by:
- Immutable experiment sealing
- Hash-based verification
- Audit logging
- Law-bound governance

---

## 🔐 DATA OWNERSHIP & BOUNDARIES

CORE guarantees that:

- Users retain ownership of their data
- Projects are isolated by default
- Engines cannot read each other’s private data
- Identities are not correlated silently
- No hidden aggregation occurs

Data only crosses boundaries when:
- Explicitly authorized
- Logged
- Auditable

---

## 📡 TELEMETRY & OBSERVABILITY

CORE guarantees that:

- Only minimal system telemetry is collected by default
- No hidden tracking exists
- No behavioral profiling exists
- No third-party surveillance exists

Any additional telemetry requires:
- Explicit consent
- Clear disclosure
- Revocation capability

---

## 🛡 SAFETY & MISUSE PREVENTION

CORE guarantees that:

- Sensor I/O is user-controlled
- Unsafe configurations are rejected
- Covert surveillance workflows are prohibited
- Misuse triggers enforcement

CORE does not provide:
- Weaponization tooling
- Covert monitoring systems
- Manipulative experimentation pathways

---

## ⚙️ GOVERNANCE & POWER LIMITS

CORE guarantees that:

- No admin has unlimited power
- All privileged actions are logged
- No silent overrides exist
- No emergency bypasses exist
- Governance changes require GitHub audit trails

The Founder is bound by the same law as all other actors once deployed.

---

## 💳 COMMERCIALIZATION WITHOUT CORRUPTION

CORE may charge for:

- Engine access
- Compute
- Storage
- Export capabilities
- Institutional features

CORE will never charge for:

- Governance exceptions
- Data ownership
- Audit suppression
- Safety bypasses
- Identity access

CORE sells **capability**, not **control**.

---

## 🧾 GIT IS LAW

CORE governance is enforced in public, versioned Git repositories.

If a rule is not written in GitHub →  
it has no authority inside CORE.

This protects users from:
- Silent policy changes
- Backdoor power
- Undocumented behavior

---

## 🧠 WHAT MAKES CORE DIFFERENT

Most platforms are:

- Simulators
- CAD tools
- Data loggers
- Closed solvers
- Analytics platforms

CORE is:

- A multi-domain physics truth platform
- A governed scientific operating system
- A reproducibility-first environment
- A safety-bound infrastructure layer

---

## ✅ FINAL STATEMENT

CORE exists to make **real science harder to fake**.

If CORE ever violates the principles stated here,  
it is no longer operating within its own law.

This statement is binding because the underlying governance is binding.
