## 🧭 CORE IS GOVERNANCE-FIRST

CORE is meta-infrastructure governed by:
- Consent over extraction
- Safety over growth
- Audit over convenience
- Git-locked law over personality

Cross-Reference:
- `CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`

---

## 🚫 NO PROFILING / NO IDENTITY TARGETING

Contributors may never:
- Build demographic targeting
- Enable protected-trait sorting
- Add identity inference

---

## 🧠 NO HIDDEN TRACKING

Contributors may never:
- Add fingerprinting
- Add shadow analytics
- Add undisclosed third-party telemetry

Telemetry must be:
✅ Disclosed  
✅ Minimal  
✅ Auditable  
✅ Removable  

---

## ⚙️ ADMIN POWER IS LIMITED & AUDITED

Contributors may never:
- Use admin access without logging
- Create silent overrides
- Disable audits
- Invent shadow roles

All power inside CORE is narrow, logged, and revocable.

---

## ⚖️ ZERO EXCEPTIONS CLAUSE

No contributor may claim:
- Time pressure
- Revenue pressure
- Partner pressure
- Investor demand
- Personal authority

…as justification for breaking CORE law.

## ✅ FINAL STATEMENT

If your values are not aligned with governed infrastructure,
you must not contribute to CORE.
