# 🧬 CORE — CONSTITUTIONAL STOP LAYER (ABSOLUTE)

Authority Level: ABSOLUTE  
Effective Date: First Public Launch  

Enforcement: Stop Layer → Constitution → System Enforcement (DB/RLS/Services) → Admin Oversight → UI

If any file, feature, service behavior, admin action, monetization rule, partnership, or investor pressure conflicts with this Stop Layer:
THIS LAYER WINS. NO EXCEPTIONS.

---

## 1) PERMANENTLY LOCKED PLATFORM LAWS (BINDING)

The following documents are non-overrideable platform law:
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md
- CORE_FOUNDER_PROTECTION_AND_SUCCESSION.md
- CORE_CONTRIBUTOR_AI_GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT.md
- CORE_CONTRIBUTOR_GOVERNANCE_NOTICE.md
- CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md

If a rule is not expressed in these laws (or formally referenced binding laws), it has no authority inside CORE.

---

## 2) ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

CORE may never:
- Sell identity access
- Enable demographic targeting or profiling pipelines
- Introduce hidden tracking or fingerprinting
- Allow silent policy changes outside Git
- Grant unlogged admin overrides
- Maintain shadow privileges for any actor (including Founder)

No exceptions exist.

---

## 3) NO UNLIMITED POWER PRINCIPLE

No human, system, admin, founder, or service account may possess:
- Unlogged override power
- Silent access to restricted data
- Governance bypass power
- Consent bypass power
- Audit disabling power

---

## 4) GIT IS LAW (ENFORCEABLE AUTHORITY ONLY)

All enforceable authority must live in:
- Git-governed law files
- Governed system enforcement definitions (RLS/policies/services derived from law)
- Audit-logged admin operations/RPCs

If a rule is not in Git law, it does not legally exist inside CORE.

---

## ✅ FINALITY

- This Stop Layer is final
- No override mechanisms exist
- No founder exception exists
- No monetization exception exists
- No admin convenience exception exists
