# 🧬 CORE — CONSTITUTIONAL STOP LAYER (ABSOLUTE)

Authority Level: ABSOLUTE  
Enforcement: Constitution → Systems Enforcement (Policy/RLS/Service Rules) → Admin Oversight → UI  
Effective Date: First Public Launch  

This document defines the highest possible authority inside CORE.

If ANY file, feature, service behavior, admin action, monetization rule, partnership,
or investor pressure conflicts with this Stop Layer:

👉 THIS LAYER WINS. NO EXCEPTIONS.

## ✅ PERMANENTLY LOCKED PLATFORM LAWS (BINDING)

These files function as non-overrideable platform law:

✅ `CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`  
✅ `CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md`  
✅ `CORE_FOUNDER_PROTECTION_AND_SUCCESSION.md`  
✅ `CORE_CONTRIBUTOR_AI_GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT.md`  
✅ `CORE_CONTRIBUTOR_GOVERNANCE_NOTICE.md`  
✅ `CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md`  

If it is not expressed in one of these files → it has no authority inside CORE.

## 🚫 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

CORE may NEVER:

- Sell identity access
- Enable demographic targeting or profiling pipelines
- Introduce hidden tracking or fingerprinting
- Allow silent policy changes outside Git
- Grant unlogged admin overrides
- Maintain shadow privileges for any actor (including Founder)

There are NO exceptions.

## ⚙️ NO UNLIMITED POWER PRINCIPLE

No human, system, admin, founder, or service account may possess:

❌ Unlogged override power  
❌ Silent access to restricted data  
❌ Governance bypass power  
❌ Consent bypass power  
❌ Audit disabling power  

---

## 🧾 GIT IS LAW

All enforceable authority must live in:

- GitHub governance files
- Governed policy enforcement definitions
- Audit-logged admin RPCs / operations

If a rule is not in GitHub → it does not legally exist inside CORE.

## ✅ FINALITY

✅ This Stop Layer is FINAL  
✅ No override mechanisms exist  
✅ No founder exception exists  
✅ No monetization exception exists  
✅ No admin convenience exception exists
