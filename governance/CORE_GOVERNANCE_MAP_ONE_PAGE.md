# 🧭 CORE — GOVERNANCE MAP (ONE-PAGE SUMMARY)

This page provides a high-level overview of CORE governance.

It does not create law.  
It reflects law already ratified.

---

## 🔒 TOP OF AUTHORITY

CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
→ absolute, non-overridable

CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
→ defines CORE identity and limits

---

## ⚖️ PLATFORM LAWS (APPLY TO EVERYTHING)

- Engine Registry & Inheritance  
- Experiment Integrity & Reproducibility  
- Telemetry & Consent  
- Sensor I/O Safety  
- Tenant & Data Separation  
- Pricing & Entitlements  
- Platform Operations & Admin Limits  

All enforced via Git + audit logs.

---

## 🧩 CORE STRUCTURE

CORE = Operating System  
Engines = Physics Truth Generators  

Engines cannot:
- Control identity
- Control permissions
- Control pricing
- Override governance

---

## 🧠 CANONICAL ENGINES

RGSR · ARES · HYDRA · THERMOS · MAGNETAR  
LITHOS · ATMOS · KINETIC · CRYSTAL · SIGNAL

Each engine:
- Is domain-scoped
- Is sandboxed
- Emits sealed artifacts
- Inherits CORE law

---

## 🔐 DATA & TRUST GUARANTEES

- Experiments are immutable once sealed
- Artifacts are hash-verified
- Projects are isolated by default
- No silent cross-engine access
- No hidden telemetry
- No admin override without audit

---

## 💳 COMMERCIAL RULES

CORE may sell:
- Capability
- Compute
- Storage
- Access

CORE may never sell:
- Control
- Governance exceptions
- Safety bypasses
- Data ownership

---

## 🧾 GIT IS LAW

All CORE authority lives in GitHub.

If it is not written in governance files →  
it has no authority inside CORE.

---

## ✅ FINAL STATE

CORE is now a:

- Governed scientific operating system
- Multi-domain physics platform
- Reproducibility-first environment
- Safety-bound infrastructure layer
