# 🤝 CORE — CONTRIBUTOR & AI GOVERNANCE CONTRACT (CANONICAL v1)

By writing, modifying, reviewing, deploying, or generating ANY code, documentation,
UI, SQL, automation, or governance material for CORE, you agree to be permanently bound by this contract.

This is not a suggestion.  
This is operational law.

## 🛡️ 1. CORE IS GOVERNED INFRASTRUCTURE

CORE is not a typical software product.
It is governed infrastructure.

You are not building features first.
You are enforcing law first.

---

## ⚖️ 2. HIERARCHY OF AUTHORITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. `CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md` (absolute)
2. `CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`
3. Canonical governance law files
4. Systems enforcement rules (policy/RLS/service constraints)
5. Admin RPCs & audits
6. UI

If anything conflicts → higher layer wins instantly.
