# 🧾 CORE — GOVERNANCE INDEX & CHAIN OF AUTHORITY (CANONICAL)

Authority Level: Canonical  
Purpose: Defines enforcement order and cross-references all binding law.

---

## ⚖️ HIERARCHY OF AUTHORITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. `CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md` (absolute)
2. `CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`
3. Founder Protection & Succession law
4. Contributor & AI Governance Contract
5. Contributor Governance Notice
6. Systems enforcement (policy/RLS/service rules) that implement the above
7. Admin RPCs and audited operations
8. UI implementation

If anything conflicts with this order → the higher layer wins instantly.
