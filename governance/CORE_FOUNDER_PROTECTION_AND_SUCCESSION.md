# 🛡️ CORE — FOUNDER PROTECTION & SUCCESSION LAW (CANONICAL)

Authority Level: Constitutional Extension  
Applies To: Founder, Admins, Developers, Contractors, Partners  
Enforcement Chain: GitHub Governance → Systems Enforcement → Admin RPCs → UI  
Effective Date: First Public Deployment  

This document exists to ensure CORE can never be captured, diluted, corrupted,
or extracted from its founding intent — even if the Founder steps away from daily operations.

CORE is not an asset to be harvested.  
CORE is a protected infrastructure system.

## 🧬 1. FOUNDER IDENTITY & ROLE (NON-CENTRALIZED BY DESIGN)

Founder Title:
- Founder & Platform Systems Architect

Permanent Functions:
- Governance steward
- Stop Layer authority
- Architecture custodian
- Enforcement & audit defender
- Curation doctrine gatekeeper

Explicitly NOT Required From Founder:
- Daily operations
- Support operations
- Moderation or content review (if applicable)
- Routine revenue operations

CORE must never structurally depend on Founder daily presence to function.

---

## 🏛️ 2. OWNERSHIP & CONTROL DOCTRINE (NON-CAPTURE)

CORE operates under an ownership model that prevents capture.

CORE may not become:
- VC-controlled
- Board-controlled
- Investor-governed
- DAO-governed (if it weakens Stop Layer authority)
- Partner-controlled via contracts

CORE may generate revenue only — never governance dilution.

---

## ⚙️ 3. POWER DISTRIBUTION LAW (NO DICTATORSHIP)

No human — including Founder — can bypass CORE law once deployed.

All privilege is:
✅ Role-scoped  
✅ Logged  
✅ Audited  
✅ Revocable  

No shadow privileges permitted.

---

## 🧾 4. GIT IS LAW — EVEN AFTER FOUNDER

No successor may:
- Remove the Stop Layer
- Add profiling fields
- Add tracking SDKs without consent law
- Create silent override power
- Rewrite governance without public Git record

If it is not written in GitHub → it has no standing authority inside CORE.

---

## 🔁 5. SUCCESSION TRIGGERS

This law activates when:
- Founder is inactive for 30+ days, or
- Founder formally steps back, or
- Founder appoints a Steward, or
- Founder becomes incapacitated

In all cases:
- Governance remains immutable
- Stop Layer remains enforceable
- Operations continue without capture privileges emerging

---

## 👤 6. STEWARD ROLE (OPTIONAL)

A Steward may:
✅ Maintain infrastructure  
✅ Maintain enforcement  
✅ Oversee operations  

A Steward may NEVER:
❌ Alter Stop Layer  
❌ Enable profiling  
❌ Introduce hidden tracking  
❌ Create unlogged overrides  
❌ Transfer control via covert agreements  

All Steward actions:
✅ Logged  
✅ Audited  
✅ Revocable  

---

## 🛑 7. HOSTILE TAKEOVER IMMUNITY

CORE is immune to:
- Corporate capture
- Investor coercion
- Influence laundering
- Surveillance capitalism pivot

Any attempt triggers:
- Immediate revocation/rollback where possible
- Forensic audit
- Permanent governance record

---

## ✅ 8. RATIFICATION

Ratified by:
- `CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`
- `CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md`
- `CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md`

Irrevocable upon first public launch.
