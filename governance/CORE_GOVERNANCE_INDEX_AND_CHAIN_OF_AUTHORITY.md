# 🏛️ CORE — GOVERNANCE INDEX & CHAIN OF AUTHORITY (CANONICAL)

File: /governance/CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_AND_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md  
Authority Level: Supreme Governance Router  
Enforcement Chain:

CORE CONSTITUTION  
→ CORE CONSTITUTIONAL STOP LAYER  
→ CANONICAL CORE LAW FILES  
→ ENGINE & PLATFORM STRUCTURE GOVERNANCE  
→ DATA / STORAGE / ARTIFACT ENFORCEMENT  
→ ADMIN & OPERATIONAL ACTIONS  
→ UI & TOOLING SURFACES  

Effective Date: First Public CORE Deployment  
Status: ✅ LOCKED | ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL

---

## 🧭 PURPOSE

This file is the **single authoritative router** for all governance inside CORE.

It defines:

- What laws exist
- The strict order they apply in
- How conflicts are resolved
- Which systems enforce which laws
- What documents carry legal authority

If anything contradicts this file → **THIS FILE WINS**.

No engine, admin action, experiment, integration, customer request, or commercial pressure may bypass this chain.

## 🏛️ GOVERNANCE HIERARCHY  
### (STRICT ORDER OF POWER — NO EXCEPTIONS)

---

## **1️⃣ CORE PLATFORM CONSTITUTION (SUPREME AUTHORITY)**

File:  
`CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`

Defines:

- CORE identity as a scientific operating system
- Non-negotiable principles (truth, reproducibility, isolation)
- Prohibition on silent power and silent data mutation
- No unlimited admin or founder authority
- Git-locked authority
- Engine non-sovereignty doctrine

If ANYTHING conflicts with the Constitution →  
**The Constitution ALWAYS wins.**

---

## **2️⃣ CORE CONSTITUTIONAL STOP LAYER (ENFORCEMENT SHIELD)**

File:  
`CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md`

Purpose:

- Permanently freezes critical governance
- Prevents:
  - Admin override
  - Commercial override
  - Emergency override
  - “Just this once” exceptions
- Locks:
  - Experiment immutability
  - Data boundary enforcement
  - Audit requirements
  - Engine isolation
- Nullifies any attempt to bypass CORE law

If a system attempts to bypass governance →  
**The Stop Layer invalidates it instantly.**

---

## **3️⃣ CANONICAL CORE LAW SET (ONLY LEGAL LAWS)**

These are the ONLY documents allowed to define:

- Power
- Access
- Data boundaries
- Experiment integrity
- Telemetry rules
- Pricing & entitlements
- Admin authority

### Canonical CORE Law Files

- `CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md`
- `CORE_EXPERIMENT_INTEGRITY_AND_REPRODUCIBILITY_LAW.md`
- `CORE_TELEMETRY_OBSERVABILITY_CONSENT_LAW.md`
- `CORE_SENSOR_IO_SAFETY_AND_MISUSE_PREVENTION_LAW.md`
- `CORE_TENANT_BOUNDARY_AND_DATA_SEPARATION_LAW.md`
- `CORE_PRICING_TIERS_AND_ENGINE_ENTITLEMENTS_LAW.md`
- `CORE_PLATFORM_OPERATIONS_AND_ADMIN_AUTHORIZATION_LAW.md`

➡ No document outside this list may define power, access, monetization, or enforcement.

All other documents are **implementation**, not law.

---

## **3.5️⃣ ENGINE & PLATFORM STRUCTURE GOVERNANCE (BINDING)**

These files define **how** CORE may be structured:

- Engine registration & lifecycle
- Engine inheritance constraints
- Engine isolation guarantees
- Vertical lenses vs physics engines
- Cross-engine data flow rules

Canonical structure files:

- `CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md`
- `registry/CORE_VERTICAL_REGISTRY.md`
- `verticals/*/CORE_*_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md`

These files:

- ❌ May not override the Constitution
- ❌ May not override the Stop Layer
- ❌ May not weaken isolation or reproducibility
- ✅ Bind all engines, workbenches, and integrations

---

## **4️⃣ DATA & ARTIFACT ENFORCEMENT LAYER**

CORE enforces governance primarily through:

- Artifact immutability
- Cryptographic hashing
- Storage isolation
- Append-only audit logs
- Explicit export & sharing pipelines

Rules:

- Engines never mutate sealed artifacts
- Admins never alter experiment outputs
- UI is never trusted alone
- All violations become audit events

---

## **5️⃣ ADMIN AS OPERATOR — NOT AS AUTHORITY**

Admins exist **below law and enforcement**.

They may:

- Operate infrastructure
- Manage access through RPCs
- Suspend engines or accounts
- Respond to incidents

They may NOT:

- Override law
- Alter sealed experiments
- Disable audits
- Create shadow privileges
- Grant undocumented power

All admin actions must be:

- Logged
- Attributed
- Auditable
- Reversible where possible

---

## **6️⃣ UI & TOOLING AS THE FINAL LAYER**

UI and tooling:

- Reflect governance
- Never define governance
- Never bypass enforcement layers

If UI behavior conflicts with:
- Law
- Artifact enforcement
- Engine boundaries

→ The UI is wrong and must be corrected.

---

## **7️⃣ PUBLIC & TRUST-FACING DOCUMENTS (NON-LAW)**

These summarize governance but do not create it:

- `CORE_PUBLIC_TRUST_AND_SCIENTIFIC_INTEGRITY_STATEMENT.md`
- `CORE_GOVERNANCE_MAP.md`
- `CORE_GOVERNANCE_MAP_ONE_PAGE.md`

---

## **8️⃣ CONFLICT RESOLUTION (ABSOLUTE)**

Engine vs CORE Law → CORE Law wins  
Admin vs Audit → Audit wins  
UI vs Enforcement → Enforcement wins  
Speed vs Reproducibility → Reproducibility wins  
Revenue vs Integrity → Integrity wins  

There is no exception path.

---

## **9️⃣ FORBIDDEN GOVERNANCE ACTIONS (PERMANENT)**

- Silent experiment mutation
- Artifact replacement under the same ID
- Cross-engine data inference
- Identity correlation without permission
- Hidden telemetry
- Admin “break glass” accounts
- Emergency suspension of law

Any attempt is treated as a **CORE platform violation**.

---

## **✅ CANONICAL STATUS**

This Governance Index is:

- Binding on all CORE contributors
- Binding on all admins
- Binding on all engines
- Binding on all future verticals
- Binding across all CORE repositories

Once committed:

> CORE governance is frozen at the authority level.  
> Everything that follows is execution only.
