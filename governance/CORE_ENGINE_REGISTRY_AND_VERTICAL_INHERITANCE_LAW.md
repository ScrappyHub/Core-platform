# 🧩 CORE — ENGINE REGISTRY & VERTICAL INHERITANCE LAW (CANONICAL)

File: `CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md`  
Authority Level: **Binding Platform Law**  
Status: ✅ LOCKED | ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL  
Effective Date: First Public CORE Deployment  

---

## 🧱 ENFORCEMENT CHAIN (STRICT · NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This law is enforced in the following order. No layer may bypass or weaken a higher layer.

1. `CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md`  
2. `CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`  
3. **CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md (this file)**  
4. `CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md`  
5. Engine-specific governance & safety files  
6. Database enforcement (RLS · Views · RPCs · Constraints · Audit)  
7. CI/CD gates & engine release pipelines  
8. UI & tooling (lowest authority)

If any conflict exists → **higher authority wins immediately**.

---

## 🧠 PURPOSE (BINDING INTENT)

This law defines, in enforceable terms:

- What CORE is — and is not  
- What a CORE Work Engine (Vertical) is — and is not  
- How engines inherit governance from CORE  
- What engines are permanently prohibited from controlling  
- The canonical CORE Engine Family registry  
- How engines are admitted, governed, executed, and audited  

This document is subordinate **only** to:

- `CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md`  
- `CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`  

If any system, document, or implementation contradicts those →  
**those documents win without exception**.

## 🧩 CORE VS WORK ENGINES (CANONICAL DEFINITIONS)

### CORE IS (OPERATING SYSTEM — NO DOMAIN TRUTH)

CORE is the operating system that provides:

- Identity & account systems  
- Project & workspace isolation  
- Data storage & artifact persistence  
- Permissions, roles, and entitlement enforcement  
- Pricing tiers & access control  
- Sensor I/O orchestration  
- Engine registration & lifecycle management  
- Experiment logging & immutable audit trails  
- Visualization shell & tooling surfaces  
- Feature flag enforcement  
- Governance & compliance enforcement  

**CORE contains no physics, solvers, or domain truth.**  
CORE never interprets reality — it governs those that do.

---

### WORK ENGINES (VERTICALS) ARE (DOMAIN TRUTH ONLY)

Each Work Engine is an isolated, single-authority domain engine that defines:

- Its own solvers  
- Its own state model  
- Its own inputs & outputs  
- Its own parameters  
- Its own validation logic  
- Its own domain-specific truth generation  

Engines **never share physics logic**.

Engines MAY share only:

- CORE UI shell  
- CORE file system abstraction  
- CORE visualization layers  
- CORE-managed data pipes  
- CORE governance enforcement  

---

## ⚖️ GOVERNANCE INHERITANCE (ABSOLUTE & IRREVOCABLE)

Every engine registered in CORE:

✅ Is permanently bound by `CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md`  
✅ Is permanently bound by `CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`  
✅ Is permanently bound by **this law**  
✅ Is governed by `CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md`  

Inheritance is **automatic, implicit, and non-optional**.

---

## 🚫 ENGINE LIMITS (HARD PROHIBITIONS)

No engine may EVER:

❌ Define or manage identities  
❌ Define roles, permissions, or access tiers  
❌ Bypass CORE audit logging  
❌ Override CORE feature flags  
❌ Alter pricing, entitlements, or monetization logic  
❌ Redefine governance or safety rules  
❌ Read or infer data from other engines without explicit CORE mediation  
❌ Mutate artifacts after sealing  
❌ Publish or export results without CORE permission  

If an engine attempts any prohibited behavior →  
**the engine is invalidated by law and must be disabled**.

---

## 🧠 CANONICAL CORE ENGINE FAMILY (LOCKED REGISTRY)

The following engines define CORE’s **physics truth layer**.

This registry is authoritative and closed unless amended by governance.

| # | Engine | Domain |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | **RGSR** | Unified multi-domain fusion |
| 2 | **ARES** | Acoustic resonance |
| 3 | **HYDRA** | Water & fluid resonance |
| 4 | **THERMOS** | Thermal dynamics |
| 5 | **MAGNETAR** | Electromagnetic fields |
| 6 | **LITHOS** | Geology & materials |
| 7 | **ATMOS** | Atmospheric physics |
| 8 | **KINETIC** | Structural mechanics |
| 9 | **CRYSTAL** | Lattice & molecular physics |
|10 | **SIGNAL** | Sensor fusion & inference |

These engines generate **ground-truth physics**.

All higher-level intelligence, analytics, and interpretation layers depend on them.

---

## 🔁 ENGINE REGISTRY AUTHORITY

An engine exists inside CORE **only if**:

- It is explicitly registered in the Engine Registry  
- It declares its identity, version, and compatibility  
- It emits signed manifests and verifiable artifacts  
- It complies with CORE governance and audit rules  

Unregistered engines **do not exist** inside CORE.

---

## 🛡️ DATA & EXECUTION BOUNDARIES

Engines:

- Operate only within authorized project scopes  
- Receive only inputs explicitly provided by CORE  
- Emit outputs only through CORE-managed pipelines  
- Never access raw user, identity, or billing data  
- Never communicate with other engines directly  

Cross-engine interaction occurs **only** through CORE-mediated data contracts.

---

## 🧾 GIT-LOCKED AUTHORITY (ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM)

This law is enforceable **only through Git-tracked authority**.

If a rule is not written in:

- `CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md`  
- or a higher authority document  

→ it has **no standing inside CORE**.

UI behavior, documentation, comments, or informal agreements  
**do not constitute governance**.

---

## 🧬 AMENDMENT REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)

Changes to this law require:

- Governance approval  
- Explicit amendment commit  
- Audit-visible Git history  
- Registry updates (if applicable)  

Silent changes are forbidden.

---

## ✅ RATIFICATION

This law is ratified and enforced by:

- `CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md`  
- `CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`  
- `CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md`  

Once committed:

> **CORE engine governance is frozen at the authority level.**  
> All future work is execution only.
