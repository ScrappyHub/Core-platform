# 🧩 CORE — ENGINE REGISTRY & VERTICAL INHERITANCE LAW (CANONICAL)

Authority Level: Platform Law  
Enforcement Chain:  
CORE Platform Constitution → Constitutional Stop Layer → Engine Registry → Data / Permissions / Feature Flags → UI  
Effective Date: First Public CORE Deployment  

---

## 🧠 PURPOSE

This law formally defines:

- What CORE is
- What a Work Engine (Vertical) is
- How engines inherit CORE law
- What engines may and may not control
- The canonical CORE Engine Family

CORE is an operating system for governed scientific engines.

CORE itself has **no physics**.

## 🧩 CORE VS WORK ENGINES (CANONICAL)

### CORE IS:

- User system
- Project system
- Data storage
- Permissions & roles
- Pricing tiers & entitlements
- Sensor I/O framework
- Engine registry
- Experiment logging
- Artifact storage
- Visualization shell
- Feature flags
- Audit & governance enforcement

CORE is the **operating system**.

---

### WORK ENGINES (VERTICALS) ARE:

Each engine is its own physics domain with its own:

- Solvers
- State models
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Parameters
- Validation logic
- Domain truth

Engines do NOT share physics with each other.

They only share:

- UI shell
- File system
- Visualization layers
- Data pipes
- Governance enforcement

---

## ⚖️ INHERITANCE RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All engines:

✅ Inherit CORE Platform Constitution  
✅ Inherit CORE Constitutional Stop Layer  
✅ Inherit CORE data, consent, and audit rules  
✅ Inherit CORE permission and role enforcement  

No engine may:

❌ Create its own identity system  
❌ Create its own permission hierarchy  
❌ Override CORE data boundaries  
❌ Bypass audit logging  
❌ Modify pricing tiers or entitlements  
❌ Redefine governance  

If an engine conflicts with CORE law → **CORE law wins instantly**.

## 🧠 CANONICAL CORE ENGINE FAMILY (LOCKED)

These engines define CORE’s physics truth layer.
