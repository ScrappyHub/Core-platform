# 🧩 CORE — ENGINE REGISTRY & VERTICAL INHERITANCE LAW (CANONICAL)

Authority Level: Binding Platform Law  
Enforcement Chain (Non-Negotiable):

1. CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
2. CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
3. CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md  
4. CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md  
5. Engine-specific governance files  
6. Data boundaries, permissions, feature flags  
7. UI and tooling  

Effective Date: First Public CORE Deployment

## 🧠 PURPOSE

This law defines, in enforceable terms:

- What CORE is
- What a CORE Work Engine (Vertical) is
- How engines inherit CORE governance
- What engines are prohibited from controlling
- The canonical CORE Engine Family registry

This document is subordinate only to:

- `CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md`
- `CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`

If any conflict exists → **those documents win immediately**.

## 🧩 CORE VS WORK ENGINES (CANONICAL DEFINITION)

### CORE IS (OPERATING SYSTEM ONLY):

CORE is responsible for:

- Identity & user accounts
- Project & workspace management
- Data storage & artifact persistence
- Permissions & role enforcement
- Pricing tiers & entitlements
- Sensor I/O orchestration
- Engine registration & lifecycle
- Experiment logging & audit trails
- Visualization shell
- Feature flag enforcement
- Governance & compliance enforcement

CORE **contains no physics, solvers, or domain truth**.

---

### WORK ENGINES (VERTICALS) ARE:

Each Work Engine is an isolated physics domain with its own:

- Solvers
- State model
- Inputs & outputs
- Parameters
- Validation logic
- Domain-specific truth generation

Engines **never share physics logic**.

Engines MAY share only:

- CORE UI shell
- CORE file system abstraction
- CORE visualization layers
- CORE-managed data pipes
- CORE governance enforcement

---

## ⚖️ GOVERNANCE INHERITANCE (ABSOLUTE)

Every engine registered in CORE:

✅ Is permanently bound by `CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md`  
✅ Is permanently bound by `CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md`  
✅ Is permanently bound by this document  
✅ Is subject to `CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md`  

No engine may:

❌ Define its own identity system  
❌ Define its own permissions or roles  
❌ Bypass CORE audit logging  
❌ Override CORE feature flags  
❌ Alter pricing tiers or entitlements  
❌ Redefine governance  
❌ Access data outside its authorized scope  

If an engine attempts to violate CORE governance →  
**the engine is invalidated by law**.

## 🧠 CANONICAL CORE ENGINE FAMILY (LOCKED REGISTRY)

The following engines define CORE’s physics truth layer:

| # | Engine | Domain |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | RGSR | Unified multi-domain fusion |
| 2 | ARES | Acoustic resonance |
| 3 | HYDRA | Water & fluid resonance |
| 4 | THERMOS | Thermal dynamics |
| 5 | MAGNETAR | Electromagnetic fields |
| 6 | LITHOS | Geology & materials |
| 7 | ATMOS | Atmospheric physics |
| 8 | KINETIC | Structural mechanics |
| 9 | CRYSTAL | Lattice & molecular |
|10 | SIGNAL | Sensor fusion & inference |

This list is authoritative.

Changes require:
- Governance amendment
- Registry update
- Git audit record

---

## 🛑 ENGINE-LEVEL PROHIBITIONS

Engines may NEVER:

- Read private data from other engines
- Infer cross-engine identity
- Modify experiment artifacts after sealing
- Publish without permission
- Override CORE safety or audit rules

---

## 🧾 GIT-LOCKED AUTHORITY

This law is enforceable **only** via GitHub.

If a rule is not written in:
- `CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md`
- or its parent authorities  

→ it has **no standing inside CORE**.

## ✅ RATIFICATION

Ratified by:

- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
- CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md
