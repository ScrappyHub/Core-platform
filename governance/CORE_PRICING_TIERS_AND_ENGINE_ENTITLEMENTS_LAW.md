## 🧠 PURPOSE

This law defines how CORE may:

- Offer paid access
- Gate engines and features
- Allocate compute and storage
- Control export and publication rights

While guaranteeing that:

- Governance is never weakened
- Safety is never bypassed
- Data integrity is never sold
- Identity is never monetized

CORE may sell **capability**, never **control**.

---

## 🧩 CORE PRICING MODEL (FOUNDATIONAL)

Pricing inside CORE applies to:

- Engine access
- Feature flags
- Compute limits
- Storage limits
- Export formats
- Publication privileges

Pricing NEVER applies to:

❌ Governance authority  
❌ Audit visibility  
❌ Data ownership  
❌ Experiment integrity  
❌ Safety enforcement  

No paid tier may override CORE law.

---

## 🧭 TIERS VS ENTITLEMENTS (IMPORTANT DISTINCTION)

- **Pricing Tier**  
  → Commercial classification (Free, Research, Pro, Institutional, etc.)

- **Entitlement**  
  → Specific capability granted by feature flags

All enforcement is entitlement-based.

Tiers are **labels**.  
Entitlements are **law-enforced switches**.

---

## 🔑 ENTITLEMENT CATEGORIES (CANONICAL)

CORE entitlements may include:

- Engine access (e.g., RGSR, ARES)
- Maximum concurrent runs
- Compute intensity
- Storage quota
- Artifact retention duration
- Export formats (CSV, HDF5, binary, etc.)
- Publication eligibility
- Collaboration scope

Entitlements must be:

- Explicit
- Documented
- Auditable
- Revocable

---

## ⚙️ FEATURE FLAG ENFORCEMENT

All paid capabilities must be enforced via:

- Feature flags
- Quotas
- Permission checks

It is forbidden to:

❌ Hardcode paid behavior  
❌ Create UI-only paywalls  
❌ Bypass flags for convenience  
❌ Grant silent entitlements  

All entitlements are logged.

---

## 🧱 ENGINE ACCESS RULES

Engines may only be accessed if:

- The user’s tier includes the engine
- The user’s role permits execution
- The project scope allows it
- All safety gates pass

Engines may NEVER self-grant access.

---

## 📤 EXPORT & PUBLICATION RIGHTS

Exporting data or publishing results may be:

- Tier-gated
- Role-gated
- Review-gated

Publication approval workflows must respect:

- CORE_EXPERIMENT_INTEGRITY_AND_REPRODUCIBILITY_LAW.md
- CORE_TENANT_BOUNDARY_AND_DATA_SEPARATION_LAW.md

Paid access does NOT guarantee publication.

---

## 🛑 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

It is forbidden to:

- Sell raw identity data
- Sell access to private experiments
- Sell governance exceptions
- Sell safety bypasses
- Sell audit suppression
- Create “VIP override” tiers

Any such attempt is enforced under:
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md

---

## 🧾 GIT-LOCKED AUTHORITY

Pricing and entitlement rules exist only as written in GitHub.

If a rule is not written here →  
it has no authority inside CORE.
