# 🧠 CORE — VERTICAL & ENGINE REGISTRY (CANONICAL)

Authority Level: Registry Law  
Effective Date: First Public CORE Deployment  

Parent Authorities:
- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md

This file is the exclusive source of truth for engines permitted inside CORE.

If an engine is not registered here, it does not legally exist inside CORE.

## REGISTRY RULES (ABSOLUTE)

1) An engine is ACTIVE only if it has:
- A registered identity and status in this file
- An engine governance file (path recorded here)
- A declared versioning policy
- Integrity hooks (audit, sealing, replay compatibility)

2) Registry changes require Git-governed amendment.
3) CORE may suspend engines for integrity/safety violations (per law).
4) Engines may not claim out-of-domain interpretation (instrument-only posture).

## 🧾 GIT IS LAW

This registry is legally binding only as committed in Git.
If it is not here, it does not exist inside CORE.
